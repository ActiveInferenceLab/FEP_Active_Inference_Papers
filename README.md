 *This is a great review which introduces the basics of predictive coding and the FEP, including the maths and contains MATLAB sample code. If you are totally new, I would start here.* 
- [**The free energy principle for action and perception: A mathematical review**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249617300962) , (2017) by *Buckley, Christopher L, Kim, Chang Sub, McGregor, Simon and Seth, Anil K* [[bib]](bibtex.bib#L14-L24) 
 
 *This is a fantastic review which presents a complete walkthrough of the mathematical basis of the Free Energy Principle and Variational Inference, and derives predictive coding and (continuous time and state) active inference. I would reccomend this as a second thing to read (although be prepared -- it is a long and serious read)*

 *A great interview with Karl. Goes into a lot of his personal motivations underlying his work on the FEP. I would reccomend this perhaps as an initial place to start out if you know nothing of the FEP to grasp the underlying motivations of *what* it is trying to explain.*

## Active Inference Outline 
Active Inference is a process theory of neurobiological function inspired by and closely related to the FEP. However Active Inference stands independent of the FEP and can be true even if the FEP is not, and similarly can potentially be falsified without impacting the FEP. The core idea behind Active Inference is the idea that the brain performs both action and perception by variational inference on a unified objective function

## Deep Active Inference
- [**Reinforcement Learning through Active Inference**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12636) , (2020) by *Tschantz, Alexander, Millidge, Beren, Seth, Anil K and Buckley, Christopher L* [[bib]](bibtex.bib#L604-L611) 
 
 *Demonstrates that the exploration afforded by the Expected Free Energy Objective is useful in a deep reinforcement learning setting. Also maintains uncertainty through model ensembles applied in a model-based RL setting.*
